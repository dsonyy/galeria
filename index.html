      <p>
        <em>The desert worms (sandworms) live on the planet Arrakis, called Shai-Hulud or Makers by the Fremen. The worms are creatures that resemble earthly annelids in appearance, but much larger - their length can reach several hundred meters, with confirmed observations of worms even over 400 meters long and 40 meters in diameter.

      <h1>Venice</h1>
      19/03/2024<br />
      50 x 40 cm<br />
      Acrylic on canvas, pencil and acrylic on paper<br />
      <div class="img">
        <a href="img/wenecja.png"
          ><img width="500" src="img/thumbs/wenecja.jpg"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        The starting point was inspiration from a work discovered while walking through the narrow streets of Venice.
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes it's difficult to escape certain thoughts and states of mind.</p>
      <p>
        Fragments of the preliminary sketch are part of the painting and remind of the first idea, the beginning of the journey.

      </div>
      <p>
        A figure reaching behind itself for all the mess of the world. Or maybe it's returning? Or perhaps standing on it? Why?

        /></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Another painting with a cosmic theme. A star, perhaps imperfect and painted quickly, but that's how it's meant to be.

      <h1>Pojnarówka</h1>
      04/2023<br />
      30 x 30 cm<br />
      Acrylic on canvas<br />
      <div class="img">
        <a href="img/pojnarowka.png"
          ><img width="500" src="img/thumbs/pojnarowka.jpg"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        A pond, forsythias, sky, silence, peace, summer. Inspired by an exhibition in a certain café where a group of friends met. The meeting was the beginning of something new. It's not yet known where it will lead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the forsythias strongly reminded me of childhood, playing with sticks from their branches, a complete lack of worries, and peace.

      <h1>Mimas</h1>
      24/12/2022<br />
      25 x 30 cm<br />
      Acrylic on canvas<br />
      <div class="img">
        <a href="img/mimas.png"
          ><img width="500" src="img/thumbs/mimas.jpg"
        /></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Mimas is a moon of Saturn, one of the smallest known celestial bodies that has a spherical shape. No, it wasn't the inspiration for the Death Star. It was photographed in sufficient resolution only a few years after the film was produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        On one hand, a boring, cold, and dead piece of rock. On the other, bombarded for billions of years by millions of smaller objects. The striking remnant of one such catastrophe is the characteristic crater <em>Herschel</em>. Its formation is dated to 4.1 billion years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        This one piece of rock traversing cosmic space has a longer history than our entire civilization and all our achievements and failures. It has outlived all our discoveries, wars, plagues, inventions, artists, writers, engineers, kings. At the same time, it remains totally bland and indifferent to everything that exists, even to itself.

      <p>
        A painting created with wine and ham during a rather pleasant moment in my life. The stars were painted using a toothpick after cheese and ham. It got slightly smudged during transport.

      <p>
        Works inspired by the art of Jan Pamuła (1944 - 2022), who specialized in graphics (including computer graphics) after a chance visit to his exhibition in Krakow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fields were generated recursively by my own script, which randomly divides the image into increasingly smaller fragments and selects a color for them from a given palette.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each specimen produced by the program is practically completely different from all the others. The number of all images that we can obtain in this way is absurdly large, many times greater than everything countable in our observable universe. In such a simple form and such simple assumptions, practically infinitely many possibilities are trapped. As humans, we can see only a fraction, and in reality, 0% of all fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        One could say that we are unable to analyze and comprehend everything that all the images in this series have to tell. On the other hand, the "artist" here is an algorithm and a mindlessly executing machine. So perhaps this means that all specimens in the series are completely barren, soulless, and constitute merely an empty sequence of zeros and ones. Maybe it's an infinitely primitive competition for machine learning models that generate images of reality on demand in today's world.
